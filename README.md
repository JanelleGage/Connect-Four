# Connect Four

Connect Four is a two-player connection rack game.

## How to Play

- Decide who goes first and what color each player will have. 
- Players alternate turns, and only one piece can be placed in a turn.
- On your turn, click where you would like to place your piece, then the next player does the same.
- The game ends when there is a 4 in a row or column of the same color.
